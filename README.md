## Introduction - 介绍
### Summary - 概要
Sudoku is a popular number puzzle that requires you to fill blanks in a 9X9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. There have been various approaches to solving that, including computational ones. In this project, I show that simple convolutional neural networks have the potential to crack Sudoku without any rule-based postprocessing.
